This is a repo for assignment 3 and assignment 4 of CS769, Spring 2022 (Instructor: Junjie Hu).

You can find our implementations of different models in the ```baseModels``` folder.

The models we used are mainly BERT-like models.

We used a contrastive loss into Fine-grained Emotions Task. We extend the Single-output Lable-Aware Contrastive Loss to Multi-Output setting.

In the end, we obtained approximately 3\% increase in Macro-F1 score using GoEmotions Dataset compared with BERT model.
